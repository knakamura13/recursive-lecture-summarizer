 1.1 Decision Trees
1.1.1 Difference between Classification and Regression
Okay, hi Michael. Hey Charles, how’s it going. It’s going pretty well, how’s it going in your end of the world? Very nice, what are we want to talk about today? Well today we are going to talk about supervised learning. But, in particular what we’re going to talk about are two kinds of supervised learning, and one particular way to do supervised learning. Okay, so the two types of supervised learning that we typically think about are classification. And regression. And we’re going to spend most of the time today talking about classification and more time next time talking about regression. So the difference between classifica- tion and regression is fairly simple for the purposes of this discussion. Classification is simply the process of taking some kind of input, let’s call it x. And I’m going to define these terms in a couple of minutes. And mapping it to some discrete label.

RESPONSE:

The text introduces a conversation on supervised learning, focusing on two types: classification and regression. Classification is described as mapping an input to a discrete label. The discussion intends to cover classification in detail and address regression in a subsequent conversation.
