Supervised learning encompasses classification and regression, assigning discrete labels and continuous values, respectively. In ML, instances are input vectors while concepts represent input-output mappings, with the target concept being the mapping to learn. The hypothesis class includes all conceivable concepts, but is constrained by the available data. Inductive learning is used to discern functions from training sets. Testing sets evaluate a model's generalization and prevent bias. Decision trees, a visualization tool used in decision-making, feature decision nodes and edges to predict outcomes like restaurant entry based on attributes. The best decision trees are selected to assess accuracy and avoid overfitting, where a false attribute (A) does not influence outcomes irrelevant of attribute (B). Decision trees can express Boolean functions like "And," "Or," and "XOR," though XOR and odd parity functions can greatly increase complexity, posing computational challenges. With functions that can double-exponentially grow (2^(2^n)), efficient algorithms like ID3 are crucial. ID3 selects attributes that maximize information gain by minimizing entropy in the training data, aiming to improve decision tree accuracy without examining all possible trees.

The text outlines how decision trees handle continuous and discrete attributes, with strategies to prevent overfitting, like pruning and using cross-validation. For continuous outcomes, appropriate splitting criteria and fitting algorithms are applied. It illustrates the misconception of the term "regression" in ML versus psychological context. Best-fitting models in ML are found through minimization of squared errors, and polynomial regression involves balancing fit and overfitting, using matrix multiplication for coefficient determination. ML models must account for noise in data representing errors. Cross-validation estimates model accuracy and helps identify the optimal model complexity, considering various input types, to minimize overfitting and underfitting.

Skepticism exists over the use of RGB for non-numeric features such as hair color. The discussed concepts include regression, mean importance for squared error, and parallels between neural networks (NNs) and brain functions. NNs use artificial neurons with adjustable inputs and weights. The Perceptron, a basic neural unit, conducts binary classification by weighing inputs against a threshold. Perceptrons create linear boundaries and perform logical functions, except XOR, which requires a combined network of AND, OR, and NOT gates. ML algorithms like the Perceptron Rule and gradient descent adjust weights, using a learning rate and considering the threshold as a bias unit. The learning rate is critical for fine-tuning weight adjustments. The Perceptron Rule applies to linearly separable data, while gradient descent, using the sum of activated inputs to minimize squared error, serves non-linear cases. Separability assessment is challenging, especially in high dimensions. Gradient descent differs from the Perceptron Rule by adjusting weights according to the gradient direction to optimize for non-linear data, although prone to local optima. Sigmoid functions replace non-differentiable step functions to provide differentiable transition states and facilitate backpropagation with smooth error gradients, despite not having finite time convergence. To escape local optima, NNs use advanced techniques like momentum and apply penalties to complex structures. NNs have evolved from linear units to more complex architectures, capable of modeling discontinuous functions by adding layers. Cross-validation is used in training to select optimal architecture and prevent overtraining. Proper architecture and weight initialization are key to avoiding overfitting and capturing complex patterns, with a preference for simpler models, following Occam's razor. The lecture also references a shift towards instance-based learning, where predictions rely on stored training data.

The lecturer discusses challenges and optimization strategies in ML, particularly the k-NN algorithm's limitations such as noise sensitivity and potential overfitting, using house price prediction as an example. The algorithm's flexibility, use of distance metrics, tie-breaking methods, and time-space requirements during learning and query phases are examined. Training involves passing all data to the query processor, and querying uses log time, with space complexity depending on data organization and k's relation to n. Linear regression is compared, noting its higher learning cost but constant querying time. The lecture covers the importance of selecting suitable distance metrics for k-NN and the impact of feature significance on distance calculation. It highlights the Curse of Dimensionality's effect on data requirements for accurate predictions as feature space expands.

The kNN algorithm's effectiveness diminishes with high-dimensional data due to the exponential growth in the required number of data points. Weighted distance functions can mitigate this by assigning weights to dimensions, offering more adaptability. Optimal 'k' selection is vague, but weighted averages provide flexible influence adjustment. Locally weighted regression aids in enhancing ML prediction accuracy by fitting models more closely to local data distributions. Techniques including decision trees, neural networks, and linear regression can be improved by using complex functions over averages, with locally weighted regression combining local data and kNN being particularly notable. Computational learning theory's learner-teacher dynamics influence the learnability of a concept, hinging on data complexity and interactions. True error, epsilon exhaustion, and sample complexity bounds are discussed, linking hypothesis space size to error and failure rates. Challenges in agnostic learning scenarios and infinite hypothesis spaces are acknowledged, with future discussions to include strategies for the latter. Ensemble learning, specifically boosting, is recommended for its ability to integrate simple rules effectively, such as in spam email detection. This method benefits from aggregating diverse evidence for improved classification, despite individual weaknesses. Neural networks and decision trees are used in ensembles to weigh and construct new rules, with performance measured by pooled model performance. Ensemble learning leverages randomness in data subsets, generating an overall model that outperforms individual subset-specific models. It is successful in reducing expected error by combining outputs from various models of possibly varying quality. In housing data, ensemble learning demonstrates increased prediction precision, validated through cross-validation of averaged third-order polynomials. Bagging, where data subset predictions are averaged to decrease variance, and boosting, focusing on difficult data points, improve ensemble outcomes. Ensemble models showed better test set performance compared to individual high-order polynomials, indicating reduced overfitting.

Boosting increases the focus on difficult examples by using a weighted mean, where error is the squared difference between actual and predicted values. ML error rate is the mismatch between actual and predicted outcomes, affected by the examples' distribution during training and testing. The error can also be viewed as the probability of a learner's incorrect hypothesis based on instance distribution. The concept of boosting is linked to learning from errors and the importance of distribution in learning. A weak learner is defined as an algorithm that performs better than chance, with an error rate under 50%. Boosting involves identifying weak learners in distributions where they can outperform randomness. The CS7641 ML lecture covers the boosting algorithm and its focus on turning a set of weak classifiers into a strong one by adjusting example weights iteratively based on classification performance. The algorithm starts with a uniform distribution and adjusts weights, using a specific formula for updating the distribution and for calculating the influence of the weak learners (alpha), which is derived from the error rate. Boosting prioritizes challenging examples by increasing their weight and refines the classifier through iteration. A final hypothesis is produced by taking a weighted average of weak classifiers determined by the natural log formula and applying a sign function. Boosting techniques use weights and natural logarithms in a performance-based approach to refine accuracy. This approach is applied to a 2D classification task, with performance assessed by an error rate of 0.21 and a corresponding alpha value, resulting in three examined hypotheses, with a preference for the one effectively separating points with greater weights.

The lecture details ensemble methods in ML, showing that combining simple hypotheses can yield complex results, similar to neural networks and weighted nearest neighbor algorithms. It highlights boosting, which adaptively adjusts weights to focus on hard examples, reducing misclassification and error rates. Techniques like boosting also prevent overfitting and are fast and effective. In discussing Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the text covers the search for the optimal hyperplane by maximizing margins and using quadratic programming. SVMs focus on support vectors as critical to the boundary, leveraging locality while optimizing with dot products and higher-dimensional projections as needed. The kernel trick is introduced, using polynomial and radial basis functions aligned with the Mercer Condition to compute high-dimensional similarities, aiding SVMs in data separation and maintaining error balance.

The text discusses strategies for reducing overfitting and improving the performance of ML algorithms through the use of boosting and SVM techniques. Boosting involves combining weak hypotheses with alpha weights to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly focusing on examples near the classification boundary. Risks of overfitting still exist, especially when strong learners like deep neural networks are used as the weak learners in boosting. Overfitting can also occur due to pink noise. Additionally, the text covers computational learning theory, stressing the importance of proper problem definition, algorithm analysis, and the quality and quantity of training data for effective ML. The interactive learning dynamic between learners and teachers in ML is explored. Learners aim to understand the data distribution through inquiry, while teachers provide data points. A "20 questions" game illustrates this, with the learner using yes-no questions to reduce hypothesis space and the teacher crafting questions that eliminate as many incorrect hypotheses as possible. Effective querying, which ideally halves the hypothesis space with each question, leads to the correct hypothesis in logarithmic steps relative to the hypothesis space size. Teachers may guide learners to a correct hypothesis using k-bit inputs despite limited questioning capacity. Identifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a hypothesis is challenging due to the vast number of potential hypotheses and the exponential time required for guessing inputs. Sample complexity is given priority over computational time, and while the "20 questions" approach is linear in execution, it is often insufficient for splitting the hypothesis class. The text suggests that difficulties arise from limited questions and negation in conjunctions. A mistake-bound learning model is proposed as a solution, where the learner adjusts predictions to minimize errors.

The speaker discusses self-sufficient ML, where errors without teacher guidance aid in refining algorithms and eliminating irrelevant variables. To optimize learning, examples should differ by only one variable and exceed the number of variables by one. Regardless of example source, maximum learner errors remain unchanged. The lesson emphasizes computational and sample complexity, introduces version space containing all hypotheses consistent with data, and underscores ensuring the true concept is among them. The XOR function exemplifies hypothesis consistency. PAC learning is explored, focusing on minimizing true error for high-confidence, low-error predictions, even for rare cases, utilizing epsilon (ε) and delta (δ) for balancing uncertainty. The necessity of multiple examples is stressed, especially with unknown distributions. The uniform selection method in version space is recommended to avoid biased decisions when data is scarce. Without domain knowledge, predictions are uncertain, and polynomial sample sizes are preferred over exponential. Epsilon exhaustion is desired in version space to ensure only low-error hypotheses remain, with ε set to a maximum of one-half to achieve this. High-error hypotheses reduce true concept match probability, guided by Haussler's Theorem on the relationship between ε, hypothesis space size, and sample size. For instance, with a 10-bit input and ε of 0.1, δ of 0.2, a formula determines necessary sample size for low error, which is relatively small and distribution-independent. ML requires adequate data proportional to desired error rates and is likened to computer science complexities, focusing on data acquisition (referred to as "new bacon") and learning strategies from nature, teachers, or learner questions. Performance is judged by mistake bounds, version spaces, and PAC learnability.

The speaker explains different aspects of hypothesis testing in ML, including how to determine sample complexity based on error tolerance, hypothesis count, and acceptable failure rate. Agnostic learning is highlighted as it selects the best hypothesis without assuming the target concept is within that hypothesis space. Flags are raised about the complexity of dealing with infinite hypothesis spaces, using examples like decision trees and neural networks, and noting that finite spaces in practice can approximate infinite ones. The VC dimension is introduced as a tool to measure a hypothesis space's capacity, demonstrating its utility with examples like the challenge of shattering three collinear points. It's noted that proving a VC dimension involves showing the impossibility of shattering beyond a certain complexity. The speaker delves into the notion of linear separators and how complexity can sometimes be reduced for ease of analysis. An increase in VC dimension with more dimensions is posited, with the dimension cited as three for linear separators. For convex polygons, the VC dimension defies easy determination, with suggestions that it could be unbounded, challenging previous assumptions about low VC dimensions in polygons.

VC dimension, a key ML concept, impacts sample size for training due to its relation with error rates and probabilities. High VC dimension indicates greater learning capacity but also larger data requirements. There's a logarithmic relationship between VC dimension and hypothesis space, with finite VC dimensions being bound by the double logarithm of the class size. PAC-learning is possible with finite VC dimensions, while infinite dimensions mean non-learnability. Neural networks' VC dimensions increase with additional nodes. Bayesian learning uses Bayes' Rule to find the most probable hypothesis combining prior knowledge and data. It's central to AI, including decision trees and neural networks, and interpreting medical test results. Bayes' Rule adjusts the probability of a condition based on test outcomes, with prior probabilities greatly influencing test interpretations. The MAP hypothesis integrates priors into the probability calculation, whereas the maximum likelihood approach omits priors, presuming equal hypothesis probability. In Bayesian learning, a consistent hypothesis probability is the ratio of version space to hypothesis space, assuming no noise, complete concept knowledge, and uniform priors. Noise affects label probability proportionally to the noise factor and compromises the accuracy of noisy hypotheses. Computing data likelihood under a hypothesis involves multiplying individual probabilities, while maximum likelihood estimation for noisy data entails fitting a hypothesis to data points with normal noise distribution.

The summary focuses on the simplification of mathematical expressions for ML optimization problems, particularly in Bayesian Learning and gradient descent. Simplification techniques include using logarithms to make products into sums and discarding constants to convert maximization to minimization. The text highlights the importance of matching noise models to data, referring to the use of Gaussian noise, and the necessity for precision in measurement. CS7641 Machine Learning is cited for showcasing Bayesian learning's hypothesis evaluation, independent of hypothesis class, unlike regression and perceptrons. The text also discusses the creation of programs for hypothesis testing, mentioning a modulus operation for predictable outcomes in weight prediction from height data. It notes that linear regression usually outperforms constant functions and data means. The text elaborates on the ability of logarithms to preserve maximum solutions and information theory's optimal code length principle. It stresses ML's preference for simpler models, analogous to decision trees with fewer nodes, and the challenge of balancing error minimization with model simplicity, highlighting overfitting risks in complex models like neural networks. Bayesian learning is praised for its error minimization congruent with Occam's razor, applied in Bayesian classification through weighted voting based on posterior probabilities. Bayes' rule, MAP, HML, and Occam's Razor are recognized as key concepts underpinning ML methodologies. Bayesian learning is considered superior on average due to its comprehensive hypothesis consideration. The expansion into Bayesian Networks is suggested for managing complex joint distributions, exemplified by weather-related probability calculations. The text underscores the utility of conditional independence rules for simplifying complex probabilistic models by reducing variable count, critical for practicable computation.

Bayesian networks (Bayes Nets) use nodes and edges to model dependencies between variables and calculate probabilities based on conditional independences, marginalization, and conditional probabilities. These networks simplify complex variable dependencies and computational intensity by employing directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures and conditional probability tables to construct joint distributions. Sampling in ML is an essential technique for approximate inference, particularly when exact inference is computationally demanding. Marginalization helps derive variable probabilities, and Bayes' rule, coupled with probability tables, aids in making predictions in uncertain conditions. For spam detection, Naive Bayes classifiers use feature dependencies (e.g., word occurrences) to discern spam and non-spam emails effectively, requiring fewer parameters than traditional methods. Naive Bayes can lead to overfitting, which is mitigated by smoothing techniques, although it makes assumptions of infinite datasets and conditional independence, which can be problematic. Bayesian inference and networks, while intricate, are crucial in ML, particularly when dealing with NP-complete problem complexity.

Bayesian learning is used for classification and probability calculation, even with missing attributes. It concludes the segment on supervised learning, hinting at a transition to unsupervised learning. The discussion of ML begins with randomized optimization aimed at finding near-optimal solutions, particularly useful in industries such as chemical engineering. Optimization in ML is essential for adjusting parameters in neural networks and decision trees to minimize error. A quiz is proposed, followed by a problem requiring optimization of a complex function using calculus, specifically, Newton's method for iterative gradient descent. However, randomized optimization or Hill Climbing algorithm may be required for complex functions to avoid local optima. The "Guess My Word" optimization uses a fitness function, an algorithm with a neighbor function, and Random Restart Hill Climbing to find the global optimum. Despite potential repetition, diverse starting points can help reach global optima in fewer tries, averaging 5.39 steps from various starting points. The speaker also determines the variable V as 29.78 and suggests that enumeration might be more efficient for small input ranges. To avoid local optima, algorithms employ strategies like quick random restarts and tracking visited points to prevent redundancy, as randomized optimization can be more efficient than full solution evaluations. Simulated Annealing, akin to Metropolis-Hastings, uses temperature variations metaphorically, accepting suboptimal steps and balancing exploration and exploitation. As temperature decreases, the move toward the global optimum is more probable, but rapid cooling may result in suboptimal solutions. This technique uses temperature to manage the probabilities of moving to points of varying fitness, gradually restricting moves to optimally explore the solution space.

The text explores Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and their optimization processes inspired by natural evolution. It explains how GAs utilize a Boltzmann distribution for selection in conjunction with fitness-based strategies like truncation or roulette wheel selection, as well as genetic operations like crossover and mutation. GAs rely on assumptions of independent optimizability of solution segments for effective crossover, discussing one-point and uniform crossover methods. It also delves into the limitations of algorithms with minimal memory, such as hill climbing and simulated annealing, while recognizing the latter's ability to represent problem space structure. The blending of algorithmic concepts and probability distribution modeling (as in the Mimic algorithm) is advocated for finding optimal solutions. The text details the use of probability distributions in evolutionary algorithms and describes techniques to refine such distributions, emphasizing dependability trees and minimizing KL divergence for feature interdependencies in ML. It also details maximizing mutual information for constructing a dependency tree using algorithms like Prim's. The MIMIC algorithm is mentioned for efficient probability sampling through dependency trees. The significance of accurate probability distribution identification is underlined for solving Boolean optimization problems, with dependency trees offering a balance between complexity and capturing relationships. The goal is to find optimal probability distributions, especially as fitness values approach uniformity.

The text explores various aspects of ML, specifically focusing on clustering and optimization algorithms. It discusses the limitations of estimating probability distributions from uniform samples and suggests generating more samples to better approximate threshold probabilities (theta > 2). For complex tasks requiring knowledge from neighboring values, the Mimic algorithm efficiently uses the structure of data to find solutions with fewer iterations than other methods like Simulated Annealing, despite its longer iteration times and increased risk of overfitting. In supervised learning, algorithms generalize from labeled data, while unsupervised learning, such as clustering, works with unlabeled data to find denser representations. Clustering, defined by the chosen algorithm, can use different measures like average or maximum distances to form clusters without needing metric spaces. Single Linkage Clustering (SLC) is deterministic and aligns with minimum spanning tree algorithms in its approach. The running time to cluster 'n' points into 'K' clusters through SLC is estimated to be cubic in 'n'. However, by using data structures like Fibonacci heaps or hash tables, time complexity may be reduced from cubic to linear. The CS7641 ML course covers SLC with 'K=2' and K-means clustering, the latter addressing issues with elongated clusters through iterative center recalculation.

The K-means algorithm iteratively refines point assignments to clusters by minimizing a distance-based scoring function until convergence. It is effective, similar to hill climbing, but convergence is contingent upon proper tie-breaking. Initial center selection is crucial and can be random or strategic, with soft clustering methods like the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm introduced for probabilistic membership. The EM algorithm alternates between assigning likelihoods to data points' cluster memberships and updating cluster centers based on these probabilities, allowing for memberships' uncertainty and showing parallel behavior to K-means when probabilities are binary. Clustering algorithm properties discussed include richness, scale-invariance, and consistency, alongside domain-specific variations that affect clustering, with Kleinberg noting that no single algorithm can simultaneously fulfill all three properties. Feature selection techniques mentioned are the 'wrap' method and the 'filter' method, each with trade-offs between thoroughness and speed.

The mini-course highlights the importance of feature transformation over feature selection for improved prediction accuracy and dimensionality management in ML by compressing a feature set rather than just selecting a subset. Techniques like PCA and ICA are introduced for data transformation. PCA reduces feature dimensionality while preserving critical information by identifying principal components that represent directions of maximal variance and are oriented orthogonally. It minimizes L2 error and maintains original data distances using eigenvalues to keep significant dimensions. ICA, in contrast, transforms features into statistically independent variables, eliminating mutual information among them and maximizing information with the original space, useful in applications like the Cocktail Party Problem to isolate individual sounds. ICA separates independent elements without imposing orthogonality, unlike PCA which maximizes variance and may inadvertently combine independent variables. RCA, another technique using random projections to maintain signal in lower dimensions, is noted for its speed but can lead to information loss. Finally, LDA is mentioned as a supervised technique requiring labels for class distinction, not to be confused with the unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. Personal graduate project experiences validate ICA's effectiveness in revealing data structures, such as edges in images.

The lecture covers ICA and PCA, with ICA providing more satisfactory outcomes in complex scenarios compared to PCA which relies on linear algebra. Unsupervised learning, decision problems, and reinforcement learning are introduced, highlighting the significance of homework and projects. Information theory plays a key role in ML, with an overview of its history and foundational principles by Claude Shannon, including entropy and Shannon's variable-length encoding exemplified by Morse code. The concept of mutual information (I) is described, including an example with coin flips illustrating joint and conditional probabilities. The lecture moves to explain Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence's role in supervised learning through model fitting. It also delves into MDPs in reinforcement learning, discussing probabilistic outcomes, transition models, and the objective of maximizing expected long-term rewards through policy optimization. Stationarity, agent decision-making, policy optimization challenges, and the effects of finite and infinite horizons on behavior and policy are discussed. The utility function (U) is explained in the context of decision-making, while grid world examples are used to illustrate reward selection and policy design, emphasizing the importance of crafting rewards to drive desired behaviors.

MDPs assume stationary policies in infinite horizons where utility accrues like bank savings. However, time constraints impact policy choices, with finite horizons prompting shifts in policy due to time's influence. Reinforcement learning introduces the regret concept, with the gamma parameter discounting future rewards' value over time; reward bounds are set by Rmax/(1-gamma) to manage infinite horizons. The optimal policy, pi star, maximizes the sum of discounted rewards, differing from non-deterministic policies that maximize expected rewards. The speaker emphasizes the need for considering future rewards in decision-making, drawing parallels between the immediate value of money and long-term educational benefits. The lecturer introduces the Bellman Equation as essential for solving MDPs and determining the optimal policy, pi star, by analyzing actions and transition probabilities to maximize expected utility. This nonlinear problem mandates iterative algorithms, with value iteration being the primary method. Accuracy is propagated through repeated utility updates until convergence, requiring a discount factor less than one. In reinforcement learning, policy iteration iteratively adjusts policies to maximize expected utility, akin to the Bellman Equation, but uses linear methods such as matrix inversions to reduce iterations. MDPs, encompassing states, actions, transitions, rewards, and discount factors, rely on discounting to assign finite values to potentially infinite reward sequences while addressing the immortality problem. The lecture concludes with reinforcement learning viewed as an API that takes transitions and learns to maximize rewards within an MDP model.

The lecture explores reinforcement learning (RL) starting from its roots in psychology, comparing it to RL in computer science where algorithms aim to maximize rewards. Focusing on model-based RL, it lays out how planners create decision-making policies using models, simulations, and algorithms such as value iteration and policy iteration. Importance is given to value functions and Bellman Equations for determining optimal policies, highlighting computational demands. The Q function, representing the value of a specific action in a given state, including future rewards from subsequent states, contrasts with the U function that maximizes Q values to define a state's utility. Q-learning specifically updates the Q estimate (Q hat) without knowing rewards or transition probabilities, thus skirting the solution of Markov decision processes (MDPs). Learning rates in Q-learning aim for iterative convergence, requiring infinite-sum learning rates with a finite sum of squares. Strategies such as αt = 1/t are suggested for convergence. The necessity of visiting every state-action pair infinitely for accurate sampling and diverse strategies in action selection for avoiding untried actions is emphasized. The lecture also notes the challenges of greedy action selection, advocating for methods like random restarts and simulated annealing to mitigate local minima and facilitate a balance between exploration and exploitation, with Epsilon Greedy Exploration mentioned as a method to ensure effective action selection. High Q-value initialization fosters exploration. Game theory is highlighted as extending RL to multi-agent scenarios, outlining its relevance in AI, and underscoring the intertwined nature of model learning, planning, and exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. The discussion doesn't delve into function approximation and larger ML issues.

The text discusses strategies in two-player zero-sum games with perfect information, where one player aims to maximize rewards while the other tries to minimize them. It explains Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and compares decision trees with unrolled MDPs. Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies are likened to game theory strategies, which are essentially state-to-action mappings. The minimax strategy is described as essential for constructing game trees and AI search algorithms, noted for its application in alpha-beta pruning and maximizing expected rewards for rational agents. The text touches on the challenge of translating game trees into matrices and vice versa, emphasizing that while matrices help determine game values, constructing decision trees from matrices is complex. Minipoker is introduced as an example of games with hidden information, increasing complexity. Mixed strategies are presented as superior to pure strategies to prevent predictability and maintain consistent expected values. Optimal strategies for players involve calculating the probability to maximize or minimize expected values within a payoff space shaped like a bow tie. The importance of von Neumann's theorem is acknowledged for non-deterministic games, but it is noted that minimax and maximin strategies do not always coincide in non-zero-sum games. The game's value is illustrated as constant across different strategies for a given player, highlighting rational decision-making processes.

In zero-sum games like the Prisoner's Dilemma, players can defect or cooperate, affecting their jail time. Mutual cooperation is optimal, but mutual defection often occurs due to its dominance. Nash equilibrium is where no player benefits from changing strategy, considering others' choices, and is present in at least one form in finite games, including symmetric and repeated scenarios. Repeated gameplay, threats, sunk costs, and trust affect decision-making, but previous efforts don't change the outcome, leading to repeated Nash equilibria. Game theory decision-making requires understanding the utility matrix and game length, and changing incentives can alter behavior. The lecture introduces game theory, using the Prisoner's Dilemma to explore strategies, including tit for tat, which cooperates initially and then copies the opponent. Outcomes depend on the continuation probability (gamma), with cooperation favored at high gamma values and defection at low values. The game's optimal strategy varies with the opponent’s behavior and is determined using payoff matrices, finite state machines, and MDPs. Nash equilibria result from mutual cooperation and defection, with no incentive to deviate from one's strategy.

Repeated games may encourage cooperation through possible indefinite rounds and retaliation, following the folk theorem's assertion that any achievable payoff better than a minmax profile can be maintained perpetually. The presented lecture inspects a prisoner's dilemma involving 'Smoove' and 'Curly', analyzing payoffs and strategies for infinite games, focusing on how cooperation can yield an average of -1 each within the convex hull of possible outcomes. It also explores minmax profiles, as exemplified by a concert-choice scenario, contrasting pure and mixed strategies, with the latter shown as superior in securing scores against adversarial actions. The intersection of feasible and preferable outcomes is identified as the feasible preferable acceptable region. Nash equilibria are sustained with adequate discount factors and coordinated strategies, where deviation incurs punishment, analyzed through strategies like grim trigger and tit for tat, which promote ongoing cooperation but differ in retaliation approaches. Additionally, Nash equilibrium in stochastic games, resembling a mix of Markov Decision Processes and repeated games, is critically important and can be computed using linear programming. Computational folk theorem suggests that sub-game perfect Nash equilibria with adaptive, cooperation-facilitating Pavlov-like strategies are computable in polynomial time for two-player games.

Achieving Nash Equilibrium in stochastic games, which generalize MDPs and can be constrained to simplify into models like zero-sum games, relies on game dynamics driven by actions and rewards. Discount factors influence outcomes and strategies, complicating these games relative to repeated games. In ML, zero-sum game Q values predict outcomes for two-player competitive scenarios, while three-player versions are treated as general-sum games. The mini-max Q learning update is introduced, converging to unique Q* like standard Q learning, though solving zero-sum stochastic games remains challenging. For general-sum games, Nash equilibrium application faces issues of non-convergence and computational difficulty, akin to NP-hard problems. Cooperative games utilize "coco values" to encourage collaboration, linking to the iterated prisoner's dilemma and reinforcement learning. The lecture touched upon credible threats, the Folk Theorem's new equilibria, computational difficulties in equilibrium computing, and the relevance of cognitive hierarchy theories. The lecturer underscored the importance of continued research and collaboration.
