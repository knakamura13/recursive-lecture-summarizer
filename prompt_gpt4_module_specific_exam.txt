The following text is a summary of the transcripts from one module of the lectures in CS7641 ML. Use the information in the summary to get an idea of what was taught in this course.

Then, create a practice exam with 5 questions, following these rules:
1. The questions must be multiple-choice, with multiple correct choices per question.
2. Each question should have at least one correct choice but no more than four correct choices.
3. Each question must have five choices.
4. The choices should be labeled A, B, C, D, E.
5. Make the exam difficult, but ensure all questions and answers are pulled directly from the lecture material.
6. Try to disambiguate the choices and avoid writing questions that rely on a technicality or a "trick" answer.
7. Try to cover the breadth of the lectures in the module so that the exam addresses the most critical information from the lectures.

Do not show me the answers. Instead, show me an answer key at the end of your response so that I can test myself.
