 1.1 Decision Trees
1.1.1 Difference between Classification and Regression
Okay, hi Michael. Hey Charles, how’s it going. It’s going pretty well, how’s it going in your end of the world? Very nice, what are we want to talk about today? Well today we are going to talk about supervised learning. But, in particular what we’re going to talk about are two kinds of supervised learning, and one particular way to do supervised learning. Okay, so the two types of supervised learning that we typically think about are classification. And regression. And we’re going to spend most of the time today talking about classification and more time next time talking about regression. So the difference between classifica- tion and regression is fairly simple for the purposes of this discussion. Classification is simply the process of taking some kind of input, let’s call it x. And I’m going to define these terms in a couple of minutes. And mapping it to some discrete label.

RESPONSE:

The text discusses supervised learning, focusing on two types: classification and regression. During this session, the emphasis is on classification, which involves mapping input (referred to as x) to a discrete label. Regression will be covered more extensively in a subsequent discussion. The key distinction between classification and regression in supervised learning is that classification deals with assigning discrete labels to inputs, while regression pertains to mapping inputs to continuous outputs.
